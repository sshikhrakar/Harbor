# Harbor &middot; [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/srishanbhattarai/Harbor.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/srishanbhattarai/Harbor)

Harbor is a tool to share Android builds of React Native projects. 

With an intuitive CLI for developers, and a simple but _effective_ mobile app for clients and QAs, you won't have to deal with the hassle of building and deploying your awesome React Native projects again.

## Usage
If you are only a recipient (i.e __not__ a developer), then just sign up using the application and you're set! Your development team will invite you to the project.

After this, you can do the following:
* View date/time, version, changelog associated with each release
* Download and open the latest release from within Harbor
* Get realtime notifications when a new release arrives.

Harbor isn't limited to this. You can setup other messaging applications (or any application, really) to receive notifications on every release. (or only certain releases - up to you)

How _awesome_ is that? :sunglasses:

If you are a developer who would like to use this tool, you would probably be more interested in the [CLI](https://github.com/srishanbhattarai/Harbor-cli).

## Motivation:
Why did I create this?

This project exists to solve problems that me (and team) have faced, due to the lack of a deployment tool for React Native, which works without hassle and with minimal configuration.

Also, I just wanted to have fun with [Redux Observable](https://redux-observable.js.org/). :satisfied:

## Contributing
There are a lot more features planned for coming releases! If you'd like to contribute, or pitch in ideas - contact me at my email. :smiley:

Additionally, there are several things I'd like to improve or refactor about the current codebase (better tests being one of them) - but simply do not have the time to do at the pace I'd like. Send in a pull request if you're interested!
